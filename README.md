![Hash Cracker](https://kristofhracza.com/Pictures/crack.png)

**NOTE:** There are 2 versions of the script. **"brute_cracker.py"**, bruteforces the number of characters you enter, **"dic_cracker.py"**, just reads a password file.

**Usage:** 

```py dic_cracker.py or py brute_cracker.py   ```

```Enter the name of the password list: ``` **ONLY FOR dic_cracker**   (Type the name of the file that contains your proper passwords), e.g.: passwords.txt

```Enter the number of characters, that you would like to use: ``` **ONLY FOR brute_cracker**   (Type the length of the guesses), e.g.: 4

```Enter the name od the hash file: ``` (Type the name of the file that contains your hashed passwords), e.g.: hashes.txt

```Enter your hashing algorithm (md5, sha1, sha256, sha512, sha3_256, sha3_512, blake2s, blake2b): ``` (Here, simply type the algorithm, that you want to use) e.g.: sha256

```Lower / Upper case hashes [l/u]: ``` (If your hashes, have upper case letters, then type "u", if they are lower case, then type "l")

***Hashing algorithms available:*** md5, sha1, sha256, sha512, sha3_256, sha3_512, blake2s, blake2b
